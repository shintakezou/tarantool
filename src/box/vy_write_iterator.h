/**
 * Iterate over an in-memory index when writing it to disk (dump)
 * or over a series of sorted runs on disk to create a new sorted
 * run (compaction).
 *
 * Use merge iterator to order the output and filter out
 * too old statements (older than the oldest active read view).
 *
 * Squash multiple UPSERT statements over the same key into one,
 * if possible.
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 * Vinyl provides support for consistent read views. The oldest
 * active read view is maintained in the transaction manager.
 * To support it, when dumping or compacting statements on disk,
 * older versions need to be preserved, and versions outside
 * any active read view garbage collected. This task is handled
 * by the write iterator.
 *
 * Filtering
 * ---------
 * Let's call each transaction consistent read view LSN vlsn.
 *
 *	oldest_vlsn = MIN(vlsn) over all active transactions
 *
 * Thus to preserve relevant data for every key and purge old
 * versions, the iterator works as follows:
 *
 *      If statement lsn is greater than oldest vlsn, the
 *      statement is preserved.
 *
 *      Otherwise, if statement type is REPLACE/DELETE, then
 *      it's returned, and the iterator can proceed to the
 *      next key: the readers do not need the history.
 *
 *      Otherwise, the statement is UPSERT, and in order
 *      to restore the original tuple from UPSERT the reader
 *      does need the history: they need to look for an older
 *      statement to which the UPSERT can be applied to get
 *      a tuple. This older statement can be UPSERT as well,
 *      and so on.
 *	In other words, of statement type is UPSERT, the reader
 *	needs a range of statements from the youngest statement
 *	with lsn <= vlsn to the youngest non-UPSERT statement
 *	with lsn <= vlsn, borders included.
 *
 *	All other versions of this key can be skipped, and hence
 *	garbage collected.
 *
 * Squashing and garbage collection
 * --------------------------------
 * Filtering and garbage collection, performed by write iterator,
 * must have no effect on read views of active transactions:
 * they should read the same data as before.
 *
 * On the other hand, old version should be deleted as soon as possible;
 * multiple UPSERTs could be merged together to take up less
 * space, or substituted with REPLACE.
 *
 * Here's how it's done:
 *
 *
 *	1) Every statement with lsn greater than oldest vlsn is preserved
 *	in the output, since there could be an active transaction
 *	that needs it.
 *
 *	2) For all statements with lsn <= oldest_vlsn, only a single
 *	resultant statement is returned. Here's how.
 *
 *	2.1) If the youngest statement with lsn <= oldest _vlsn is a
 *	REPLACE/DELETE, it becomes the resultant statement.
 *
 *	2.2) Otherwise, it as an UPSERT. Then we must iterate over
 *	all older LSNs for this key until we find a REPLACE/DELETE
 *	or exhaust all input streams for this key.
 *
 *	If the older lsn is a yet another UPSERT, two upserts are
 *	squashed together into one. Otherwise we found an
 *	REPLACE/DELETE, so apply all preceding UPSERTs to it and
 *	get the resultant statement.
 *
 * There is an extra twist to this algorithm, used when performing
 * compaction of the last LSM level (i.e. merging all existing
 * runs into one). The last level does not need to store DELETEs.
 * Thus we can:
 * 1) Completely skip the resultant statement from output if it's
 *    a DELETE.
 *     |      ...      |       |     ...      |
 *     |               |       |              |    ^
 *     +- oldest vlsn -+   =   +- oldest lsn -+    ^ lsn
 *     |               |       |              |    ^
 *     |    DELETE     |       +--------------+
 *     |      ...      |
 * 2) Replace an accumulated resultant UPSERT with an appropriate
 *    REPLACE.
 *     |      ...      |       |     ...      |
 *     |     UPSERT    |       |   REPLACE    |
 *     |               |       |              |    ^
 *     +- oldest vlsn -+   =   +- oldest lsn -+    ^ lsn
 *     |               |       |              |    ^
 *     |    DELETE     |       +--------------+
 *     |      ...      |
